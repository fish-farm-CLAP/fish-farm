Our project is to create a Fish Farm game.

Game Overview:
  You start the game with 2 fish, $100, and 10 fish food. Each fish has a corresponding button on the page. Periodically, each fish gets hungry. If the fish's button is clicked on and the player has fish food, one food will be subtracted and the fish's hunger timer will be reset. If a fish goes hungry for too long, it dies. Periodically, the fish will increase your amount of money based on how many times they've been fed. Money is used to buy new fish and more fish food. Difficulty increases over time by the way of random events affecting the cost of fish food, the amount of fish alive, and the hunger of the fish. The game ends when all fish are dead. Throughout the game, a score counter is incremented, and the goal is to get a high score.
