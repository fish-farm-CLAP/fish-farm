Our project is to create a Fish Farm game.

Game Overview:
  You start the game with 2 fish, $100, and 10 fish food. Periodically, each fish gets hungry. If a fish goes hungry for too long, it dies. If the fish is clicked on and the player has fish food, one food will be subtracted and the fish will no longer be hungy. A fish that has been fed several times will start to earn the player money when fed, which can be used to buy new fish or more fish food. Difficulty increases over time by the way of random events affecting things like the amount of fish alive, the speed of the fish, and the hunger of the fish. The game ends when all fish are dead. Throughout the game, a score counter is incremented, and the goal is to get a high score.
