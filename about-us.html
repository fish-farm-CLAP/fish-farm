    <p>After 6 years in the Air Force and a year with AWS, Lucas wanted to learn how to code but didn't want to go back
      to college, so he went to Code Fellows and learned how to make stuff like this. When he's not feeding fish, he's
      probably playing another game or trying to code something.</p>

    <p>Austin is eighteen years old and has only recently graduated high school, so he doesn't have much work experience
    besides the few months he spent working as a cashier at walmart. He came to codefellows to explore carrer options.
    His interests mostly involve things with a degree of creativity
